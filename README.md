I'm a Developer with a passion for creating web and mobile applications. I specialize in both frontend and backend technologies. Here are some of the technologies I work with:

Frontend:
- React Native: I build cross-platform mobile applications that offer a native-like experience using React Native.
- React.js: I develop responsive and dynamic web applications with React.js, making use of its component-based architecture.

Backend:
- Node.js: I create server-side applications and APIs using Node.js, making use of its non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high performance.
- NestJS: I enjoy working with the NestJS framework for building scalable and maintainable Node.js applications. It provides a powerful modular architecture and a variety of useful features.
